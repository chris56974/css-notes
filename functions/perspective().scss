/*
  perspective() defines a transformation that sets the distance between the user and the z=0 plane.
  The perspective refers to where the viewer would be if the 2-dimensional interface were 3-dimensional. 
  Its result is a <transform-function> data type.

  It determines the distance between the z=0 plane and the user in order to give a 3D positioned element some perspective.

  The perspective() transform function is part of the transform value applied on the element being transformed. 
  This differs from the perspective and perspective-origin properties which are attached to the parent of a child transformed in 3-dimensional space.
