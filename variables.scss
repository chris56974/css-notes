// CSS vars are reusable values for different properties.
// They're scoped, can't be cascaded and are targetable via JS.
// They're not good for breakpoints, use SCSS vars instead.

:root { // <html>
	--my-variable: red;
}

p {
	// blue is a default but it's only meant for when the css variable isn't defined yet
	// so you might define it later with JS
	color: var(--my-variable, blue); 
}

// you can inline the css var 
// <div style="--my-variable: 5;" />
