/*
  backface-visibility sets whether or not the back face of an element is visible when turned towards the user.
  It only works when the object is being represented in 3D space. It's GPU accelerated for performance
  An element's back face is a mirror image of its front face. 
  Though invisible in 2D, the back face can become visible when a transformation causes the element to be rotated in 3D space.
