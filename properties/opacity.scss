  Setting the opacity will apply transparency to the whole element including its content 
  Setting the alpha on the RGBA background-color will only affect the background color.

  opacity only creates a stacking context when you have any other value than 1. 
  z-index only creates a stacking context when you have overlapping positions (relative and absolute).
