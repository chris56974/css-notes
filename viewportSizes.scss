/*
  I don't know the difference yet

  There are actually four different viewport sizes (large, small, dynamic and default)
  The reason why there are four of them, is because the browser expands and retracts dynamically 
  And when it does so it is hiding/showing content underneath

  Small viewport uses sv units 

  large viewport uses lv units

  dynamic viewport uses dv units
