/*
  Logical properties and values use the abstract terms "block" and "inline" to describe the direction in which they flow.
  The physical meaning of these terms depends on the writing mode (ltr, rtl, etc).

  Block dimension
  The dimension perpendicular to the flow of text within a line, i.e., the vertical dimension in horizontal writing modes, and the horizontal dimension in vertical writing modes. For standard English text, it is the vertical dimension.

  Inline dimension
  The dimension parallel to the flow of text within a line, i.e., the horizontal dimension in horizontal writing modes, and the vertical dimension in vertical writing modes. For standard English text, it is the horizontal dimension.
